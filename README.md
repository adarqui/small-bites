The intent of this repo is to create a quick reference for a variety of languages. The idea is based off of:

	http://matt.might.net/articles/learning-scala-in-small-bites/

For the most part, we will have:

	variables & values
	functions
	iteration
	arithmetic
	string operations
	objects, structures, classes & methods
	threads, workers, async operations, etc
	files & io
	client/server operations, network io
	algorithms

The fun I have with programming is linearly correlated with the amount of languages I know/work with. Sometimes I find myself needing an extremely quick refresher, that's where this project comes in.

pc!
